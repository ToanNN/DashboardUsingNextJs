# Notes

## userSearchParams() hook vs searchParams prop

<Search> is a Client Component, so you used the useSearchParams() hook to access the params from the client.
<Table> is a Server Component that fetches its own data, so you can pass the searchParams prop from the page to the component.
As a general rule, if you want to read the params from the client, use the useSearchParams() hook as this avoids having to go back to the server.
